    # Choose destination for Lab.
    LAB=/path/to/lab
    # Install dependencies.
    sudo apt-get install mercurial python python-matplotlib python-simplejson
    # Clone Lab repository.
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab ${LAB}

Notes about requirements:

* Lab needs Python 2.7 or Python >= 3.5.
* python-matplotlib is only needed for reports that generate graphs.
* python-simplejson is optional, but makes generating reports much faster.

Add to your ``.bashrc`` to make Lab available on the ``PYTHONPATH``::

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/lab

Update shell configuration::

    source ~/.bashrc

Installing with ``pip``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If preferred, Lab can also be installed directly through ``pip``:

    # Choose destination for Lab.
    LAB=/path/to/lab
    # Install dependencies.
    sudo apt-get install mercurial python python-pip
    # Clone Lab repository.
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab ${LAB}
    # Perform the installation
    cd ${LAB}
    pip install .

Using ``pip install -e .`` instead of ``pip install .`` will install the project in "editable mode", which is more
suitable for development purposes, since modifications to the source in ``${LAB}`` are immediately reflected in the
installed package.

We recommend using this installation procedure within a Python virtual environment.

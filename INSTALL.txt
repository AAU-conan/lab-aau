::

    # Choose destination for Lab.
    LAB=/path/to/lab
    # Install dependencies.
    sudo apt-get install mercurial python python-matplotlib python-simplejson
    # Clone Lab repository.
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab ${LAB}

Notes about requirements:

* Lab needs Python 2.7 or Python >= 3.5.
* python-matplotlib is only needed for reports that generate graphs.
* python-simplejson is optional, but makes generating reports much faster.

Add to your ``.bashrc`` to make Lab available on the ``PYTHONPATH``::

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/lab

Update shell configuration::

    source ~/.bashrc

Install Lab in a virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An alternative way to install Lab is by using a
`Python virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_. This has the advantage that
there is no modification to the system-wide configuration, and that you can create multiple environments with different
Lab versions (say, for development purposes) with no conflicts at all. Using Python3, you would proceed like this:

::

    # Install required packages, including virtualenv.
    sudo apt install mercurial python3 python3-venv
    # Create and activate a Python3 virtual environment where Lab will be installed.
    python3 -m venv lab-venv  # Or any other name instead of lab-venv
    source lab-venv/bin/activate

    # Clone Lab repository.
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jendrikseipp/lab ${LAB}
    # Perform the installation.
    pip install -e ${LAB}

The ``-e`` flag in the last command is optional, and  will install the project in "editable mode",
which is better suited for development purposes, since modifications to the source in ``${LAB}`` are immediately
reflected in the installed package.

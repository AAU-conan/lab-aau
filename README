=== lab ===
This project contains a python package for conducting and analyzing
experiments that run on single machines or on computer clusters.
The lab package can be found in the "lab" directory.
The directory "examples/simple" contains a very basic usage example.

A second package that makes use of the lab package is located in "downward".
It can be used to run experiments and create custom reports for the
Fast Downward planning system (www.fast-downward.org).
The script "examples/initial-opt-config.py" is an example Fast Downward
experiment.


=== Requirements ===
- Python 2.6 or 2.7
- Only tested on Linux
- The base directory (containing "lab" and "downward") must be on the PYTHONPATH

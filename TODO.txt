Roadmap
=======

* Custom attributes with aggregation function, information about whether "max_wins" and whether the attribute is absolute.
* Move Plot class into lab.reports
* Unify domain and problem report
* Allow using kwargs for category styles
* Count as solved if problem is found unsolvable. Check if problem is really unsolvable (suites.py).
* If no data is found for a table include the header and an explanation.
* Add PlotReport(plot_options) parameter (http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html).

Roadmap
=======

* Move Plot class into lab.reports
* Add option for choosing between scattering and plotting points in ProblemPlotReport
* Do not allow casting parsed values to bool, because any matched string will evaluate to True.
* Infer output_format from outfile and vice-versa.
* Add pep257 tool to tests.

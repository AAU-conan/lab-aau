Roadmap
=======

* Make sure that proper memory padding is added in src/search/portfolios.py

* Move Plot class into lab.reports
* Add option for choosing between scattering and plotting points in ProblemPlotReport
* Infer output_format from outfile and vice-versa.
* If rev is set for a checkout use it as a default for dest.
* add_resource use filename as default for destination filename.
* Add exp.add_report method.
* profile report generation and make it faster
  * For a big report taking 42s we spend
    - 19s converting txt2tags to html.
    - 10s generating the markup.
    -  9s decoding json. ultrajson would probably only make this ~1.15 times faster.
    -  3s scanning the planning data.
    -  1s applying filters.

Maybe
-----
* Enumerate run dirs from 0 to 99 instead of 1 to 100. This yields better tab completion.

Not-todo
--------
* Warn when config or nick in filter is not present in dataset. We would need
  to enable this for all attributes. If we filter for a single item
  "filter_attr='not-here'" a warning is already shown. For lists this becomes
  trickier: We cannot easily find out if one of the values in
  "filter_attr=['here', 'not-here']" does not exist in the dataset.
